# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project 

## Overview
I was tasked with helping a fictional bike-share company called Cyclistic that was based in Chicago. My job was to analyze their bike-share rider information that included individuals who were considered "casual" riders and individuals who were "members". The task that was given to me was to find out how to convert casual riders into members.

## Description:
Background Information: Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. They offer more than 5,800 bicycles at 600 docking stations to provide transportation to various users based on their pricing plans. These plans include single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Riders who purchase single and full-day passes are considered casual riders while annual memberships are considered Cyclistic members. 

## Business Task:
What could motivate casual riders to change to an annual subscription?
